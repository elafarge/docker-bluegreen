#
# This script updates a running docker-compose blue/green configuration.
# It first pulls down the new docker image from DockerHub (or whatever image
# repository one would like to use).
# It then redirects all the traffic to green, kills blue, relaunches it with
# the new Docker Image.
#
# At that point, things start to get interesting: the script will hold until
# the health checks passes on blue. If it doesn't after 1 minute, the script
# exists with an error code and green is not updated.
# This way, we can make sure that we keep one running, valid version of our
# code whatever happens. When a new image gets deployed, if it's valid, it will
# start on blue.
#
# Eventually, if blue starts well then greens gets updated but we don't wait
# for it's health check to be complete. HAProxy makes it so that no traffic
# will be redirected to it while it's still unhealthy.
